## Machine Learning with Python

In this notebook I practiced all the classification algorithms that I learned in the professional course by IBM for Data Science ([Machine learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/home/welcome)), on Coursera. The data set used is provided by coursera.

I load a dataset using Pandas library, applied the necessary algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.
Other libraries used include; Numpy, Matplotlib, SkLearn and Itertools
